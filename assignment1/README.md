A bag of marbles can be a very simple thing to model. 

I think a bag of marbles might have only one or two simple properties. 
An upper bound for marble carrying capacity, and how many marbles are currently in the bag. 

A few behaviors of a marble bag model could be adding, removing, and counting the marbles inside.

In the program I created, I made a simple class with those three methods described above. A simple way to test the methods are to check the count
after using adding or removing methods. I used a while loop to engage with the user in the console. 

I might have missed some proper coding conventions because I have no C++ experience, so this might need adjustment when I learn the standard.
