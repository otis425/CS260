## Assignment Requirements
### Design:
Create a design illustrating how data can be stored in a hash table and the problems it can solve.
### Testing:
Develop tests (minimum one per functionality) to validate the hashtable's functionality before coding.
### Simple Hashtable:
Implement a basic hashtable resolving collisions by overwriting old values with new ones.
Describe the hashing method used.
Implement insert and contains functions.
### Smarter Hashtable:
Implement a smarter hashtable using double hashing or chaining.
Include the same functions as the simple hashtable.
Collision Comparison:
Analyze collision frequency and its impact on complexity for insert and contains methods.
